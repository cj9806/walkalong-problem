# Walkalong

This is a general purpose examples solution, the goal is to develop a collection of examples of C#
code which can supplement student learning and be used to help get an understanding of C# programming
and good/best practices for students to follow.

Some projects will be basic, some will have deliberate errors for troubleshooting other will answer specific 
questions or challenges seen in the classroom.
